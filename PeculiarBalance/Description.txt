The first element of the output list should correspond to the 1-unit weight, the second element to the 3-unit weight, and so on. Each
string is one of:

"L" : put weight on left-hand side
"R" : put weight on right-hand side
"-" : do not use weight

To ensure that the output is the smallest possible, the last element of the list must not be "-".

x will always be a positive integer, no larger than 1000000000.
