Inputs:
    (int list) heights = [1, 4, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3]

Look for first increased height; 4 @ index 1
look for next >= height: 5, @ index 3: pair, (1,3)

Starting from 3:
Look for first increased height: (none)
Since none, look backwards from last index for next highest: 5, at index 3: Pair (3, 6)


Inputs:
    (int list) heights = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Look for first increased height: 3 @ index 2
Look for next >= height: (none)
Since none, look backwards from last index for next highest: 3 @ index 2
    Pair (2, 2) [degenerate]


5312
look for first increased: (none)
Since none, look backwards for next highest: 3 @ index 1
    Pair (1, 3)


Pairs in [8,1,8,7,3,7,2,4]
(0, 2) (3, 5) (5, 7)


When finding the start and end of the edges, keep going until it's non-increasing
When finding a matching tower, go until it's higher than the matching tower
