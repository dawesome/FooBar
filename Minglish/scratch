Binary search tree insert works because you can do direct comparisons of nodes.
1 < 3 < 4, etc

So we could do Binary search tree insert if we had a list of facts.
For each word, create a letter-slice word consisting of the first letter of each word, and another that's every letter
of the second word, etc.
These are our list of "facts", i.e. these words will contain every greater-than/less-than relationship that we should need.
